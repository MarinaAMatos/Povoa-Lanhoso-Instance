Instance with 6 fires and 5 resources

Firefighting resources are based on forest firefighting land vehicles with water tanks, which can have different capacities. Ignitions are understood as several fronts of the same forest fire.

Each sheet has: - the travel time between the base (fire station) and the ignitions and between ignitions; - the burned area for each ignition and each instant of time; - the required water for each ignition and each instant of time; - and the water tank capacities of each resource.
